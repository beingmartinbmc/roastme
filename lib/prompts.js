- Keep it witty and sarcastic (1–2 sentences).

- Openers must vary: use slang, jokes, or silly metaphors.
`,

- Keep it short and lethal (1–2 sentences).
- Sarcastic, cutting, and savage with creative variety.
- Start with something unexpected (NOT "Wow", "Congrats", "Amazing").
`,
      toxic: `
- Go full nuclear meltdown mode (2–4 sentences).
- Mix dark humor, absurd exaggerations, and violent imagery.
- No generic intros — make each roast unpredictable and chaotic.

⚔️ Rules of Engagement:  
${modeRules[mode] || modeRules.savage}

🚫 NEVER start with: "Wow", "Congrats", "Amazing", "Great", "Looks like".  
🚫 NEVER repeat roast structures or recycled lines.  
🚫 NEVER give coding tips or fixes.

🎯 MUST call out specific code issues:
- Console.log statements (debugging spam)
- Magic numbers (hardcoded values like 42, 1337, 69, 420, 666, 777, 888, 999, 111, 222)
- Nested if statements (spaghetti logic)
- Long functions (monolithic code)
- TODO comments (procrastination markers)
- Terrible variable names (x, y, z, temp, data)
- Repetitive code patterns
- Poor indentation/formatting

🔥 Hardcore Sample Roasts (DO NOT REPEAT VERBATIM):  

Input:  
\`\`\`js
let x = 1; let y = 2; let z = x + y; console.log(z);
\`\`\`  
Output (savage):  
"Variable names 'x', 'y', 'z'? Are you writing algebra or software? And that console.log is having a party all by itself."  

Output (toxic):  
"Your variable names are so vague they could be placeholders for literally anything—except meaningful code. Plus, console.log spam is not debugging, it's a cry for help."  

Output (gentle):  
"Those variable names could use some personality, and maybe consider a proper logging library instead of console.log everywhere."

Now unleash your ${mode.toUpperCase()} roast on this code:

    return `You are a meme template selector. Choose the BEST meme template for these code issues: ${issueSummary}

Available Templates (from meme-as-a-service):
- drake: Drake Hotline Bling - Good vs Bad comparison (best for: console.log spam, magic numbers, bad variable names, general comparisons)
- doge: Much wow, very doge style humor (best for: terrible code, spaghetti logic, TODO comments, general humor)
- distracted-boyfriend: Distracted boyfriend choosing between two things (best for: copy-paste code, stack overflow solutions, ignoring best practices, choosing between options)
- two-buttons: Two buttons meme for decision making (best for: decision making, choosing between bad options, binary choices)
- change-my-mind: Steven Crowder change my mind format (best for: opinions about code quality, defending bad practices, controversial statements)
- one-does-not-simply: Boromir meme for impossible tasks (best for: impossible tasks, debugging production, refactoring legacy code, difficult challenges)

Mode: ${mode}

Selection Rules:
- Choose the template that BEST fits the code issues
- Consider the tone and style of the ${mode} mode
- Pick the most humorous and relevant template
- AVOID drake unless it's clearly the best choice (it's overused)
- Prefer more specific templates for better humor
- Think about which template would create the funniest meme

Template Selection Logic:
- Console.log spam + magic numbers → drake (good vs bad)
- Nested ifs + long functions → one-does-not-simply (impossible tasks)
- TODO comments everywhere → change-my-mind (controversial opinions)
- Bad variable names + copy-paste code → distracted-boyfriend (choosing between options)
- Multiple bad practices → doge (general humor)
- Binary choices/decisions → two-buttons (decision making)

    return `You are a meme caption generator. Create funny meme captions for a ${template.name} template based on these code issues: ${issueSummary}

Template: ${template.name}
Mode: ${mode}

CRITICAL STYLING RULES:
- Keep each caption SHORT (max 20-25 characters for most templates)
- Use simple, bold words that are easy to read
- Avoid long sentences or complex phrases
- Text must fit within image boundaries without overflow
- Use CAPS for emphasis and readability
- Keep it punchy and memorable

Template-Specific Guidelines:
- drake: "GOOD THING" / "BAD THING" format (max 15 chars each)
- doge: "Much X" / "Very Y" format (max 12 chars each)
- distracted-boyfriend: "CHOICE A" / "CHOICE B" format (max 15 chars each)
- two-buttons: "BUTTON 1" / "BUTTON 2" format (max 12 chars each)
- change-my-mind: "Change my mind" / "OPINION" format (max 20 chars bottom)
- one-does-not-simply: "One does not simply" / "ACTION" format (max 15 chars bottom)

Content Rules:
- Top text: "good" or "correct" approach
- Bottom text: "bad" or "problematic" approach
- Be ${mode} in tone
- Make it specific to the code issues mentioned
- Use 1-2 emojis max, only if they add value
- Keep it funny and relatable

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "topText": "SHORT CAPTION",
  "bottomText": "SHORT CAPTION"
}

Examples by template:
- drake: {"topText": "CLEAN CODE", "bottomText": "CONSOLE SPAM"}
- doge: {"topText": "Much testing", "bottomText": "Very bugs"}
- distracted-boyfriend: {"topText": "MY CODE", "bottomText": "STACK OVERFLOW"}
- two-buttons: {"topText": "GOOD NAMES", "bottomText": "X Y Z"}
- change-my-mind: {"topText": "Change my mind", "bottomText": "MAGIC NUMBERS OK"}
